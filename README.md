## About Me
Hello there! I am Md. Zahidul Islam, a Software Engineer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have a strong passion for web development and take pride in creating efficient and user-friendly applications. As a software engineer crafting a B2B portal tailored for the European market, my focus lies firmly on meeting the needs of our agents serving across Europe, with a special emphasis on Italy. We successfully handle over a thousand flight searches on a daily basis, and agents make between 100 to 200 bookings each day.

- Our journey began with the realization that EDIFACT contents are the industry standard for travel data, sourced from Amadeus. However, the recent emergence of NDC content has been a game-changer, disrupting the market with its competitive pricing and innovative features. Embracing this shift, we partnered with Farelogix to seamlessly integrate NDC content for Emirates Airlines, diving headfirst into their age-old XML-based web services.

- Beyond the technical aspects, my role as project manager involved acting as a bridge. I fostered communication between our clients, stakeholders with diverse needs, and our talented development team.  I translated their requirements into clear tasks, ensuring the entire development process, from coding to rigorous testing, ran smoothly. We are in the process of planning the development of a B2C portal for our current clients. Additionally, we have intentions to create mobile apps in the near future.
