## About Me
Hello there! I am Md. Zahidul Islam, a Software Engineer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have a strong passion for web development and take pride in creating efficient and user-friendly applications. I am currently employed at Dhaka Popular Travel Ltd, where I am involved in an exciting project. Our team is diligently working on developing a sophisticated B2B flight search portal catering to agents in Italy. We successfully handle over a thousand flight searches on a daily basis, and agents make between 50 to 100 bookings each day.
